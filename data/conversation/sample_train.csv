( some interesting experiences : i once had a conversation with two flemish-dutch speakers , one of which spoke dialect , one of which didn't . the guy who spoke standard flemish-dutch had to act as an interpreter . i also had a short conversation yesterday with a man who spoke afrikaans , and although we hit a few snags , i was able to mix dutch vocabulary and afrikaans syntax to make myself intelligible to him . it was pretty cool . :D ) see also : * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch-based_creole_languages * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_words_of_Dutch_origin * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans","in all honesty , i have a tough time understanding people from the deep south . between all the wacky turns of phrases and shashasha na lissen heaya boye i doubt a long time outsider could do much with it ."

"" in those areas i don't think people should be biking at all since it's so much safer to just go one or two streets down . some sidewalks , like on yonge for example , will never be appropriate for bikes . but i think those places are the exception and most streets in the city have enough room for separated bike lanes .  like yonge ? ! yonge is totally fine for biking . i have no problem cycling on yonge . traffic can be dense but it's not usually too fast . unless you're talking north of eglinton or something .  i just meant the sidewalks on yonge . that just does not sound safe for anyone , lol .","okay , well you're right about that . once people get used to cycling on sidewalks on those big bad scary roads then they're more likely to keep cycling on the sidewalk in the downtown areas ."

"" stranger danger "" and all that . i wasn't trying to imply btw that this would be a valid excuse , just that it would be an excuse people would make and that would be accepted at face value by the majority of the population ."
